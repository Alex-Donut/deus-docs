##### Trading is usually reffered to a zero-sum game because one person gaining is equivalent to someone else losing. 
This in the long-term means traders are paying each other out. 
Now in the beginning where there is a disbalance of traders or more are just profiting than losing the exchange is the one that pays out.
##### Where Do These Profits come from?
In the event there is more profits than losses from traders the exchange relies on Vaults, these vaults are overcollaterized by 350% meaning for every $1 being traded there has to be $3.50 locked. 
In the very rare case of traders still profiting more than this there is also an insurance fund and also the Deus treasury.
