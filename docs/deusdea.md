#### Key factors for having two protocol tokens

###### DEUS cannot be pre minted and thus couldnt be used for the Liquidity Mining event.
###### Liquidity mining was meant to let people engage with the DEUS protocol, by letting them farm those "pre-minted" DEA until we launch the stock trading platform.
###### DEA was idealized to become a stablecoin, but was voted against by the community.
###### DEA became a low supply coin that has unlimited upside and is the perfect pick for users that had issues with DEUS low price sensetivity.
