### Benefit from constant buybacks, and a less volatile setup
___


### DEUS Key factors

#### - DEUS is backed by ethereum: [Treasury#1](https://etherscan.io/address/0xD77700fC3C78d1Cb3aCb1a9eAC891ff59bC7946D) & [Treasury#2](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc2fB644cd18325C58889Cf8BB0573e4a8774BCD2)
#### - Can be exchanged for ethereum at any time at [DEUS Swap](app.deus.finance/swap) the bonding curve goes on forever.
#### - The Liquidity generation event created a price bottom for DEUS at 0.0015ETH.
#### - DEUS Supply is infinite, but DEUS price moves on a bonding curve.
### In layman terms:
Higher supply means higher price on [DEUS Swap](https://app.deus.finance/swap)
##### Buying [here](https://app.deus.finance/swap) increases the supply.

___
Bonus for DEUS holders:
Everytime there is a Stock buy on DEUS Swap, there will be a buyback in the background that mints more DEUS which results in a price increase of DEUS at DEUS Swap.
The constant buybacks ensure not the biggest but consistent gains.

The casino always wins, and DEUS holders essentially insure the casino, getting paid no matter which way the wrapped stonks go. The bonding curve does not allow for any explosive gains / or devestating fast crashes.


____


#### For example:
##### Currently at 1,644,162 DEUS in circulation price is at 0.0025ETH
##### At 2,317,537 DEUS in circulation price would be at 0,005ETH
The config of the market maker (bonding curve) is designed so there is a steady / linear price progression
