DEUS is envisioned as a DAO-governed project, with the elected members of the [DAO Council] serving as the representatives of the majority.

The team will facilitate a gradual transition from a team-led operation to a community-led system, operated by experts, democratically elected by the holders of our governance token DEA. Each individual's voting power will be proportional to his share of DEA.

With each development progression comes an active exchange of ideas with our community of investors, enthusiasts, and expert advisors, to ensure a working ecosystem that delivers on its promise.

We will be openly discussing potential and vision, possible ecosystem and market risks, and malicious actors. Additionally, we are preparing external reviews of the token economy and an eventual security audit of the platform.
