The tokenomics of DEUS finance can be divided into two parts: the temporary development stage which will last until all of the systemâ€™s parts are in their place, and the mature stage when DEUS reaches its final form. 

To avoid confusion we decided to call the current tokenomics as **v0.X** and the future tokenomics as **v1.0**. In the following entries we describe the tokens and their purpose in the current state, while also providing v1.0 sections to give you an idea of where each token is headed.
