#### - DEA is not a stablecoin, as it was [voted](https://t.me/deusfinance/33986) by the community to not mint any more tokens (shards).
#### - The segniorage stablecoin system will still be developed but eventually without DEA as a keyrole as the community demanded.
#### - Pooling DEA to provide an exit gateway for Vault stakers, enables you to earn the maximum Fees inside the DEUS ecosystem.
#### - Can be bought on [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x3b62f3820e0b035cc4ad602dece6d796bc325325&outputCurrency=0x80ab141f324c3d6f2b18b030f1c4e95d4d658778) or [DEUS Swap](https://app.deus.finance/swap).
#### - 110,000 the maximum circulating supply, have been distributed during the Liquidity mining event until mid of January.

#### Why having two protocol tokens?

###### DEUS cannot be pre minted and thus couldnt be used for the Liquidity Mining event.
###### Liquidity mining was meant to let people engage with the DEUS protocol, by letting them farm those "pre-minted" DEA until we launch the stock trading platform in late December 2020.
###### DEA was idealized to become a segniorage stablecoin, but was voted against by the community.
###### The segniorage stablecoin system will still be developed but eventually without DEA as a keyrole.
###### DEA became a low supply coin that has unlimited upside and is the perfect pick for users that had issues with the low price sensetivity of the DEUS token.
