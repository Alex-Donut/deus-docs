## Why have two protocol tokens?

DEUS could not be pre-minted and thus could not be used for the liquidity mining event. Liquidity mining was meant to let people engage with the DEUS protocol, by letting them farm pre-minted DEA until we launch the stock trading platform by late December 2020.

DEA was initially supposed to become a stablecoin, but the idea was vetoed by the community. Instead, DEA became a low supply coin that has unlimited upside and is the perfect pick for users that had issues with the low price sensetivity of the DEUS token. 

The seigniorage stablecoin system will still be developed eventually, but with a different coin serving this role.
