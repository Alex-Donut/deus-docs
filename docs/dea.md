- DEA is not and never will be a stablecoin, as it was [voted](https://t.me/deusfinance/33986) by the community to not mint any more tokens (shards).
- There will not be a DEA V1 Stablecoin. The seigniorage stablecoin(The system planned for DEA) will still be developed but eventually without DEA as a keyrole as the community demanded. This coin will be called differently. 
- Pooling DEA to provide an exit gateway for Vault stakers, enables you to earn the maximum Fees inside the DEUS ecosystem.
- Can be bought on [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x3b62f3820e0b035cc4ad602dece6d796bc325325&outputCurrency=0x80ab141f324c3d6f2b18b030f1c4e95d4d658778) or [DEUS Swap](https://app.deus.finance/swap).

## Why have two protocol tokens?

DEUS could not be pre-minted and thus could not be used for the liquidity mining event. Liquidity mining was meant to encourage users to engage with the DEUS protocol, by letting them farm pre-minted DEA until the launch of the stock trading platform by late January 2021.

DEA was initially concieved as a stablecoin, but this idea was vetoed by the community. Instead, DEA became a low supply coin that has unlimited upside and is the perfect complement to the low price sensitivity of the DEUS token.

A seigniorage stablecoin system will also be developed eventually, but with a different coin serving this role.

DEA is used to partially collateralize the protocol. It is also the primary source of fees earned by liquidity providers. In order to become liquidity providers users need DEA to enter the Balancer pools, around 70% of which are composed of DEA in some form. Those pools earn around 70% of all fees. In later stages other assets, like WBTC, will be added as collateral.
