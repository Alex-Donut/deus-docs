#### Why having two protocol tokens?

###### DEUS cannot be pre minted and thus couldnt be used for the Liquidity Mining event.
###### Liquidity mining was meant to let people engage with the DEUS protocol, by letting them farm those "pre-minted" DEA until we launch the stock trading platform in late December 2020.
###### DEA was idealized to become a segniorage stablecoin, but was voted against by the community.
###### The segniorage stablecoin system will still be developed but eventually without DEA as a keyrole.
###### DEA became a low supply coin that has unlimited upside and is the perfect pick for users that had issues with the low price sensetivity of the DEUS token.
