Deus allows users to trade Futures for IPOs and other financial instruments.

- Step 1: Static Sale Price
- Step 2: Curve trading of Future product
- Step 3: Conversion of Future to real Asset price when trading starts

FAQ:

- What is the Static Sale?

The Static Sale is the initial sale of liquidity to traders. The Future is bought with DEUS at a static price and a capped max amount. Once this initial phase is completed, the Future can then trade at a dynamic price based on the AMM curve chosen for the individual Future.

- How is the Future traded after the Static Sale?

After the Static Sale is completed, users can trade the Future normally using the AMM liquidity contract.

- What if I buy the Future at 2x the static sale?

This means you expect the asset to trade at least 2x the price it starts trading on the real market when the IPO launches.

- What if I buy the Future at half the static sale price?

This means you can sell the token immediately when the real trading starts and make a gain of 100%.

- How is the Future product converted to the Real asset when trading starts?

In the case of the Coinbase Future, the conversion will be based on the price in DEUS of the static sale (50 DEUS) times the time weighted average price of DEUS during the static sale (around $145). The amount of wCOINBASE in your wallet will automatically adjust. 

- What happens if the IPO does not end up happening?

Users can continue to trade the Future as long as they believe an IPO will happen. If users do not believe this is the case anymore, then they can sell their tokens to the AMM.
