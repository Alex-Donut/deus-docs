## What are Vaults?

Sands of Time vaults are time-lock contracts in which you are providing liquidity and collateral to the stock trades.
Vaults are essential in the ecosystem because without the collateral there are no trades.
When locking up your tokens you will receive sToken and Time tokens in return (sDeus,sDea,sUni-LP,etc..) which you can use to stake to earn Dea/rewards from fees and trader losses.
##### Keep in mind that collateral provided can not be withdraw until end of time-lock period.

## What is the time-lock period?

Vaults will run in periods of time, called "Trading Seasons".
These Trading Seasons will run for _ blocks or approx 6 months.
At the end of these Trading Seasons the sTokens may be exchanged for your locked collateral.
##### The First Trading Seasons in DEUS ecosystem began January 8, 2021 and is estimated to end July 8, 2021.

## What if I want to exit Vaults?

As stated previously, collateral provided will not be able to be withdrawn from Vaults, but you may sell your sTokens at any time.
Your sTokens are your position in the Vault; these may be sold through Balancer for Dea.
There is an arbitrage bot which should get sTokens close to 1:1, but there is always some slippage and fees to keep in mind.
##### Reminder: Once you sell your sTokens you no longer can redeem original collateral provided. (Selling sDea is like selling your Dea)

## What are the Risks?

While staking is a good way to earn passive income, liquidity providers must exercise due diligence before locking their tokens in the Vaults.
The possibility of a partial loss of fund is tiny, as traders as a whole tend to underperform the market rather than outperform. It should still be mentioned and considered.
In the future, different Vaults will exist for different asset classes and high-risk assets will be separated from their low-risk counterparts allowing stakers more freedom in risk management. 


## How are these risks reduced?

- Over-collateralization
- The possibility for traders to go Long and Short (Short profits get paid by Long losses)
- Stock profit caps
- Insurance fund
