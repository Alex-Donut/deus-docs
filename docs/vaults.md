title: Sands of Time Vaults
---

Sands of Time vaults will be staking contracts with time-locking features. At launch, only 6 month contracts will be available. This 6 months lock is necessary to bootstrap the platform to its full potential and will serve as the minimum viable product. Vaults with different time frames and risk levels will be added later. 

#### Staking Risks

While staking is a good way to earn passive income, liquidity providers must excercise due diligence before locking their tokens in the vaults. Each vault comes with its own level of risk exposure that must be considered. 

The maximum loss for a vault staker in the DEUS ecosystem is 35%, due to the profit cap on stocks being 350% and the 1000% overcollateralization. 

In the future, different vaults will exist for different asset classes, and high-risk assets will be separated from their low-risk counterparts, allowing stakers more freedom in risk management.
