title: Sands of Time Vaults
---

Sands of Time vaults will be staking contracts with time-locking features. At launch, only 6 month contracts will be available. This 6 months lock is necessary to bootstrap the platform to its full potential and will serve as the minimum viable product. Vaults with different time frames and risk levels will be added later. 

#### Staking Risks

While staking is a good way to earn passive income, liquidity providers must excercise due diligence before locking their tokens in the vaults.

There is a potential risk and partial loss of Funds is possible.

The losses are reduced by 

#### over-collateralization
#### the possibility for traders to go Long and Short (Short profits get paid by Long losses)
#### Stock profit caps
#### Insurance fund


The possibility is still infinitely little for it to happen, as traders as a whole tend to underperform the market rather than outperform. It should be mentioned and considered.



In the future, different vaults will exist for different asset classes, and high-risk assets will be separated from their low-risk counterparts, allowing stakers more freedom in risk management.
