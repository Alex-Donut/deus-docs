#### Staking Risks

Vaults are providing liquidity and collateral to the stock trades, the system is designed in a way that LONGs are paying SHORTs and vice versa.

While staking is a good way to earn passive income, liquidity providers must excercise due diligence before locking their tokens in the vaults.

There is a potential risk and partial loss of Funds is possible.

### The losses are reduced by 

#### over-collateralization
#### the possibility for traders to go Long and Short (Short profits get paid by Long losses)
#### Stock profit caps
#### Insurance fund


The possibility of a partial loss of fund is tiny, as traders as a whole tend to underperform the market rather than outperform. It should still be mentioned and considered.



In the future, different vaults will exist for different asset classes, and high-risk assets will be separated from their low-risk counterparts, allowing stakers more freedom in risk management.
